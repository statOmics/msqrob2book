# Preamble

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}

    warning = FALSE,
    message = FALSE
)
```

The aim of this book is to provide thorough documentation of the
`msqrob2` software for the statistical analysis of mass spectrometry
(MS)-based proteomics data. It includes the latest improvements of the
software that enable statistical modelling for a wide panel of use
cases. The book will first introduce the general concepts behind
the statistical analysis of proteomics data and `msqrob2`. Further
chapters will demonstrate the application of `msqrob2` for datasets
that were obtained using different acquisition strategies, different
instruments, and different search engines to answers different
biological questions. We hope that this book will help proteomics
researchers tailoring their statistical analysis workflow to their
specific datasets and research questions.

## Why msqrob2?

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics experiments often imposes a
complex correlation structure among observations. Addressing this
correlation is key for correct statistical inference and reliable
biomarker discovery. This `msqrob2` book provides a set of (mixed) model-based
workflows tailored toward differential abundance analysis for label-free as well as labeled MS-based proteomics data. The key features of `msqrob2` workflows
are:

1. Modularity: all core functions rely on the `QFeatures` class, a
   standardised data structure, meaning that output of a function can
   be fed as input to any other function. Hence, different functions
   are assembled as modular blocks into a complete data analysis
   workflows that can be easily adapted to the peculiarities of any
   MS-based proteomics data set. Therefore, the approach extends well
   beyond the use case presented in this chapter
2. Flexibility: the `msqrob2` modelling approach relies on the
   `lme4::lmer()` model specification syntax, meaning that any linear
   model can be specified. For fixed effects, this includes modelling
   categorical and numerical variables, as well as their interaction.
   Moreover, `msqrob2` can model both sample-specific and
   feature-specific (e.g. peptide or protein) covariates, which
   unlocks the inference to experiments with arbitrarily complex
   designs as well as to correct explicitly for feature-specific
   properties.
3. Performance: thanks to the inclusion of robust ridge regression, we
   demonstrated improved performance of `msqrob2` workflows upon the
   competing software [@Goeminne2016-tr;@Sticker2020-rl;@Vandenbulcke2025-sj].

## Outline

**TODO** write outline of the different chapters

## Targeted audience and assumed background

The course material is targeted to either proteomics practitioners or
data analysts/bioinformaticians that would like to learn how to
analyse proteomics data. 

A working knowledge of R (R syntax, commonly used functions, basic
data structures such as data frames, vectors, matrices, ... and their
manipulation) is required. Familiarity with MS or proteomics in
general is recommended, this would allow for a better understanding of
the modelling assumptions taken throughout this book. Familiarity with
other Bioconductor omics data classes and the tidyverse syntax is
useful, but not necessary.

We **highly recommend** reading [Chapter
5](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/book/sec-quant.html) of the
R for mass spectrometry book. 

## Setup

To install all the necessary package, please use the latest release of
R and execute:

**TODO** install dependencies
**TODO** provide a Docker image

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
```

All software versions used to generate this document are recorded at
the end of the book in chapter \@ref(sec-end).
