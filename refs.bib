              proteomic research. It enables relative quantification of proteins
              from multiple biological samples in a single MS run with high
              efficiency and high throughput. However, experiments often require
              more biological replicates or conditions than can be accommodated
              by a single run, and involve multiple TMT mixtures and multiple
              runs. Such larger-scale experiments combine sources of biological
              and technical variation in patterns that are complex, unique to
              TMT-based workflows, and challenging for the downstream
              statistical analysis. These patterns cannot be adequately
              characterized by statistical methods designed for other
              technologies, such as label-free proteomics or transcriptomics.
              This manuscript proposes a general statistical approach for
              relative protein quantification in MS- based experiments with TMT
              labeling. It is applicable to experiments with multiple
              conditions, multiple biological replicate runs and multiple
              technical replicate runs, and unbalanced designs. It is based on a
              flexible family of linear mixed-effects models that handle complex
              patterns of technical artifacts and missing values. The approach
              is implemented in MSstatsTMT, a freely available open-source
              R/Bioconductor package compatible with data processing tools such
              as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, OpenMS, and SpectroMine.
              Evaluation on a controlled mixture, simulated datasets, and three
              biological investigations with diverse designs demonstrated that
              MSstatsTMT balanced the sensitivity and the specificity of
              detecting differentially abundant proteins, in large-scale
              experiments with multiple biological mixtures.",

              relative quantitation of proteins in complex samples. However,
              numerous issues inherent to the mass spectrometry workflow turn
              quantitative proteomic data analysis into a crucial challenge. We
              and others have shown that modeling at the peptide level
              outperforms classical summarization-based approaches, which
              typically also discard a lot of proteins at the data preprocessing
              step. Peptide-based linear regression models, however, still
              suffer from unbalanced datasets due to missing peptide
              intensities, outlying peptide intensities and overfitting. Here,
              we further improve upon peptide-based models by three modular
              extensions: ridge regression, improved variance estimation by
              borrowing information across proteins with empirical Bayes and
              M-estimation with Huber weights. We illustrate our method on the
              CPTAC spike-in study and on a study comparing wild-type and ArgP
              knock-out Francisella tularensis proteomes. We show that the fold
              change estimates of our robust approach are more precise and more
              accurate than those from state-of-the-art summarization-based
              methods and peptide-based regression models, which leads to an
              improved sensitivity and specificity. We also demonstrate that
              ionization competition effects come already into play at very low
              spike-in concentrations and confirm that analyses with
              peptide-based regression methods on peptide intensity values
              aggregated by charge state and modification status (e.g.
              MaxQuant's peptides.txt file) are slightly superior to analyses on
              raw peptide intensity values (e.g. MaxQuant's evidence.txt file).",

              challenges on the data analysis because of peptide-specific
              effects and context dependent missingness of peptide intensities.
              Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob, test for DE directly from
              peptide intensities and outperform summarization methods which
              first aggregate MS1 peptide intensities to protein intensities
              before DE analysis. However, these methods are computationally
              expensive, often hard to understand for the non-specialized
              end-user, and do not provide protein summaries, which are
              important for visualization or downstream processing. In this
              work, we therefore evaluate state-of-the-art summarization
              strategies using a benchmark spike-in dataset and discuss why and
              when these fail compared with the state-of-the-art peptide based
              model, MSqRob. Based on this evaluation, we propose a novel
              summarization strategy, MSqRobSum, which estimates MSqRob's model
              parameters in a two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of
              peptide-based workflows. MSqRobSum maintains MSqRob's superior
              performance, while providing useful protein expression summaries
              for plotting and downstream analysis. Summarizing peptide to
              protein intensities considerably reduces the computational
              complexity, the memory footprint and the model complexity, and
              makes it easier to disseminate DE inferred on protein summaries.
              Moreover, MSqRobSum provides a highly modular analysis framework,
              which provides researchers with full flexibility to develop data
              analysis workflows tailored toward their specific applications.",

               workflows specifically designed for differential abundance
               analysis in labeled mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.
               msqrob2TMT accommodates both sample-specific and feature-specific
               (e.g., peptide or protein) covariates, facilitating inference in

               our innovative workflows against state-of-the-art tools,
               including DEqMS, MSstatsTMT, and msTrawler, using two spike-in

               the highest possible purity without compromising on sensitivity
               and coverage achieved in the experiment. Here we report the first
               systematic study optimizing delayed fragmentation options on
               Orbitrap instruments. We demonstrate that by delaying peptide
               fragmentation to occur closer to the apex of the chromatographic
               peak in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
               experiments cofragmentation is reduced by 2-fold and peptides are
               fragmented with 2.8-fold better signal-to-noise ratios. This
               results in significantly improved accuracy of isobaric mass tag

               on isolation width. In comparison to Orbitrap XL instruments the
               reduced space charging in the Orbitrap Velos enables isolation
               widths as narrow as 1 Th without impairing coverage, thus
               substantially reducing cofragmentation. When delayed peptide

               applied, cofragmentation-induced ratio compression could be
