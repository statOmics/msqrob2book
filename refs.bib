              from multiple biological samples in a single MS run with high
              efficiency and high throughput. However, experiments often require
              more biological replicates or conditions than can be accommodated
              by a single run, and involve multiple TMT mixtures and multiple
              runs. Such larger-scale experiments combine sources of biological
              and technical variation in patterns that are complex, unique to
              TMT-based workflows, and challenging for the downstream
              statistical analysis. These patterns cannot be adequately
              characterized by statistical methods designed for other
              technologies, such as label-free proteomics or transcriptomics.
              This manuscript proposes a general statistical approach for
              relative protein quantification in MS- based experiments with TMT
              labeling. It is applicable to experiments with multiple
              conditions, multiple biological replicate runs and multiple
              technical replicate runs, and unbalanced designs. It is based on a
              flexible family of linear mixed-effects models that handle complex
              patterns of technical artifacts and missing values. The approach
              is implemented in MSstatsTMT, a freely available open-source
              R/Bioconductor package compatible with data processing tools such
              as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, OpenMS, and SpectroMine.
              Evaluation on a controlled mixture, simulated datasets, and three
              biological investigations with diverse designs demonstrated that
              MSstatsTMT balanced the sensitivity and the specificity of
              detecting differentially abundant proteins, in large-scale

              numerous issues inherent to the mass spectrometry workflow turn
              quantitative proteomic data analysis into a crucial challenge. We
              and others have shown that modeling at the peptide level
              outperforms classical summarization-based approaches, which
              typically also discard a lot of proteins at the data preprocessing
              step. Peptide-based linear regression models, however, still
              suffer from unbalanced datasets due to missing peptide
              intensities, outlying peptide intensities and overfitting. Here,
              we further improve upon peptide-based models by three modular
              extensions: ridge regression, improved variance estimation by
              borrowing information across proteins with empirical Bayes and
              M-estimation with Huber weights. We illustrate our method on the
              CPTAC spike-in study and on a study comparing wild-type and ArgP
              knock-out Francisella tularensis proteomes. We show that the fold

              methods and peptide-based regression models, which leads to an
              improved sensitivity and specificity. We also demonstrate that
              ionization competition effects come already into play at very low

              peptide-based regression methods on peptide intensity values
              aggregated by charge state and modification status (e.g.
              MaxQuant's peptides.txt file) are slightly superior to analyses on

              challenges on the data analysis because of peptide-specific
              effects and context dependent missingness of peptide intensities.
              Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob, test for DE directly from
              peptide intensities and outperform summarization methods which
              first aggregate MS1 peptide intensities to protein intensities
              before DE analysis. However, these methods are computationally
              expensive, often hard to understand for the non-specialized
              end-user, and do not provide protein summaries, which are
              important for visualization or downstream processing. In this
              work, we therefore evaluate state-of-the-art summarization
              strategies using a benchmark spike-in dataset and discuss why and
              when these fail compared with the state-of-the-art peptide based
              model, MSqRob. Based on this evaluation, we propose a novel

              for plotting and downstream analysis. Summarizing peptide to
              protein intensities considerably reduces the computational
              complexity, the memory footprint and the model complexity, and
              makes it easier to disseminate DE inferred on protein summaries.
              Moreover, MSqRobSum provides a highly modular analysis framework,

               deteriorated with diet and advancing age, with long-term high fat

               changes culminated with alterations in 155 proteins involving
               primarily the urea cycle (e.g. ARG1, CPS1), immune

abstract = {Optimal performance of LC-MS/MS platforms is critical to generating high quality proteomics data. Although individual laboratories have developed quality control samples, there is no widely available performance standard of biological complexity (and associated reference data sets) for benchmarking of platform performance for analysis of complex biological proteomes across different laboratories in the community. Individual preparations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome have been used extensively by laboratories in the proteomics community to characterize LC-MS platform performance. The yeast proteome is uniquely attractive as a performance standard because it is the most extensively characterized complex biological proteome and the only one associated with several large scale studies estimating the abundance of all detectable proteins. In this study, we describe a standard operating protocol for large scale production of the yeast performance standard and offer aliquots to the community through the National Institute of Standards and Technology where the yeast proteome is under development as a certified reference material to meet the long term needs of the community. Using a series of metrics that characterize LC-MS performance, we provide a reference data set demonstrating typical performance of commonly used ion trap instrument platforms in expert laboratories; the results provide a basis for laboratories to benchmark their own performance, to improve upon current methods, and to evaluate new technologies. Additionally, we demonstrate how the yeast reference, spiked with human proteins, can be used to benchmark the power of proteomics platforms for detection of differentially expressed proteins at different levels of concentration in a complex matrix, thereby providing a metric to evaluate and minimize preanalytical and analytical variation in comparative proteomics experiments.}
