It includes the latest improvements of the\nsoftware that enable statistical modelling for a wide panel of use\ncases. The book first introduces general concepts of\nstatistical proteomics data analysis and `msqrob2`. Further\nchapters will demonstrate the application of `msqrob2` for assessing\ndifferent biological questions starting from datasets with different\nexperimental designs, acquisition strategies, instruments, and search\nengines. The book aims to help proteomics researchers and data analysists tailoring their statistical analysis workflow to their specific datasets and research questions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The sticker is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).](figs/msqrob2.png){width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Why msqrob2?\n\nMS-based proteomics experiments often imposes a complex correlation\nstructure among observations. Addressing this correlation is key for\ncorrect statistical inference and reliable biomarker discovery. This\n`msqrob2` book provides a set of (mixed) model-based workflows\ndedicated to differential abundance analysis for label-free as well\nas labeled MS-based proteomics data. The key features of `msqrob2`\nworkflows are:\n\n1. Modularity: all core functions rely on the `QFeatures` class, a\n   standardised data structure, meaning that output of a function can\n   be fed as input to any other function. Hence, different functions\n   are assembled as modular blocks into a complete data analysis\n   workflows that can be easily adapted to the peculiarities of any\n   MS-based proteomics data set. Therefore, the approach extends well\n   beyond the use case presented in this chapter\n2. Flexibility: the `msqrob2` modelling approach relies on the\n   `lme4::lmer()` model specification syntax, meaning that any linear\n   model can be specified. For fixed effects, this includes modelling\n   categorical and numerical variables, as well as their interaction.\n   Moreover, `msqrob2` can model both sample-specific and\n   feature-specific (e.g. peptide or protein) covariates, which\n   unlocks the inference to experiments with arbitrarily complex\n   designs as well as to correct explicitly for feature-specific\n   properties.\n3. Performance: thanks to the inclusion of robust ridge regression, we\n   demonstrated improved performance of `msqrob2` workflows upon the\n   competing software [@Goeminne2016-tr;@Sticker2020-rl;@Vandenbulcke2025-sj].\n\n## Outline\n\nThe book is divided in three parts.\n\n### Concepts\n\nThis parts introduces the user to the key concepts in differential proteomics data analysis and provides extensive description of the code. While this part is conceptual, the concepts are illustrated using a real spike-in study.\n\n- @sec-basics introduces the basic concepts for MS-based \n  proteomics analysis. We **recommend** our users to first read this \n  chapter before reading any other chapter. \n- @sec-advanced builds upon the previous chapter and \n  introduces more advanced concepts that will be used in later chapters\n  that involve complex designs and analyses.\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nThis part illustrates how to benchmark data analysis workflows and\ndemonstrates how the guidelines presented in this book were derived.\nThe main sections of the chapters in this part are intended for\nadvanced users with R programming skills. However, the conclusions in\neach chapter are more accessible and also intended for entry-level\nusers that want to understand how to apply the guidelines and\nrecommendations to their analyses.\n\n- [Chapter @sec-benchmarking] explains how to conduct a \n  benchmarking experiment that compares different workflows. As an\n  example, the chapter compares the performance when starting from the\n  different MaxQuant input files: the evidence file, the peptides\n  file, and the protein-group file. The same benchmark strategy could be \n  used to compare different data sources, such as data generated by\n  different sample preparation protocols, LC-MS  approaches\n  and/or search engines.\n- @sec-workflow-optimisation demonstrates how to optimise\n  a data analysis workflow. As an example, the chapter compares the\n  performance of two normalisation approaches (median of ratios and\n  median centering) in combination with three summarisation approaches\n  (median, median polish, and robust regression).\n\n### Use cases{#sec-overview_use_cases}\n\nThis part contains a set of chapter that illustrate the data analysis\nfor a range of experimental designs and technological setups.\n\n- @sec-francisella analyses the francisella use case: a \n  MaxQuant LFQ DDA dataset with technical replication.\n- @sec-heart analyses the heart use case: a MaxQuant\n  LFQ DDA dataset with a more complex design.\n- @sec-mouse-diet analyses the mouse diet use case: a Skyline\n  TMT DDA dataset.\n\n**TODO** make table with dataset descriptions to let users easily find\ntheir relevant use case.\n\n## Targeted audience and assumed background\n\nThe course material is targeted to either proteomics practitioners or\ndata analysts/bioinformaticians that would like to learn how to\nanalyse proteomics data. \n\nA working knowledge of R (R syntax, commonly used functions, basic\ndata structures such as data frames, vectors, matrices, ... and their\nmanipulation) is required. Familiarity with MS or proteomics in\ngeneral is recommended, this would allow for a better understanding of\nthe modelling assumptions taken throughout this book. Familiarity with\nother Bioconductor omics data classes and the tidyverse syntax is\nuseful.\n\nWe **highly recommend** reading the [quantitative proteomics\nchapter](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/book/sec-quant.html)\nof the R for mass spectrometry book.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo install all the necessary package, please use the latest release of\nR and execute:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n    install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nBiocManager::install(c(\n   \"BiocParallel\",\n   \"BiocFileCache\",\n   \"ComplexHeatmap\",\n   \"dplyr\",\n   \"ExploreModelMatrix\",\n   \"ggpattern\",\n   \"ggplot2\",\n   \"ggrepel\",\n   \"impute\",\n   \"MsDataHub\",\n   \"patchwork\",\n   \"scater\",\n   \"tidyr\",\n   \"bookdown\"\n))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAll software versions used to generate this document are recorded at\nthe end of the book in @sec-end.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you need to cite this book, please use the following reference:\n\n**TODO** add citation when available on Zenodo (and paper)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank the [R for Mass\nSpectrometry](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) initiative: \n\n- For developing the `QFeatures` package on which `msqrob2` depends\n- For openly sharing their\n  [book](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/book), which we used\n  as a template.\n\n## License\n\n<a rel=\"license\"\nhref=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\"><img\nalt=\"Creative Commons Licence\" style=\"border-width:0\"\nsrc=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br\n/>This material is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\"\nhref=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.
