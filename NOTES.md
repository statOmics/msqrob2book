## General TODOs

- Discuss further how msqrob2 handles missing values, that it assumes
  MAR upon conditioning for peptide species. We could also demonstrate
  the hurdle model.
- Demonstrate msqrob2PTM
- Include de Median of Ratios normalisation in QFeatures
- Advanced chapter: we could mention that the variance components for 
  the label random effects are almost alway 0, so could be ignored.
  Also maybe introduce shrinkage of the variance once we have explored
  this futher.
